# coqui-tts-test

Testing [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) for the English models

## Generated Samples

Samples for each of the models is under [audio-samples/](audio-samples/) and generated via a simple [bash script](generate-tts-samples.sh)

The [input text](sample.txt) is from a fun article I had open from Pocket: https://getpocket.com/explore/item/original-catfluencer-how-a-victorian-artist-s-feline-fixation-gave-us-the-internet-cat
